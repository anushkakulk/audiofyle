spotify recommendation system using K-NN algorithm and Spotify Web API

# origins
While fiddling around with the Spotify Web API, I thought it would be interesting to see how the recommendation algorithm changed when prioritizing different factors, like popularity, genre, tempo, and energy. I began this project thinking that creating a custom  to experiment with a basic yet efficient classifying ML algorithm would be a great way to grasp the utility of the model. 

# frameworks/libraries used
- spotipy: python lib for spotify api (https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.22.1/)
- sklearn: using sklearn for nearest neighbors implementation (working to recreate the model manually)
