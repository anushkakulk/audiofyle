spotify recommendation system using K-NN algorithm and Spotify Web API

# origins
While fiddling around with the Spotify Web API, I thought it would be interesting to see how the recommendation algorithm changed when prioritizing different factors, like popularity, genre, tempo, and energy. I began this project thinking that creating a custom deployment to experiment with a basic yet efficient classifying ML algorithm would be a great way to grasp the utility of the model. 

# stack
- Backend: Flask
  -  spotipy: python lib for working with spotify 
  -  scikit-learn: using scikit-learn for normalized mutual info to test robustness of model
      
- Frontend: React
  - next.js
